But, J Crew also collects 7% state sales tax which comes out to $2.10 on a $30 coat. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy total cost is:<br />\r\n$30 coat + $2.10 state sales tax - $3 Panda rebate = $29.10<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe rebate is treated as a reduction of the purchase price and additionally, the transaction has already been taxed. If I receive a 1099 form, I will be taxed twice - once on the initial purchase and a second time on the cash back rebate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/1027015.pdf\">www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/1027015.pdf</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere\'s a quote from the first paragraph on page 3 in the PDF linked above (and also attached):<br />\r\n&quot;Section 61 provides that gross income means all income from whatever source derived. A rebate received by a buyer from the party to whom the buyer directly or indirectly paid the purchase price for an item is an adjustment in purchase price, not an accession to<br />\r\nwealth, and is not includible in the buyer’s gross income. &quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgain, in the conclusion section on page 5:<br />\r\n&quot;(1) The portion of the credit card purchases that Taxpayers can either receive back in cash or request Company to pay to a charity does not constitute gross income to Taxpayers under §61.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease advise on how to proceed with the W9 form. If needed, my CPA can send an official document to your accountant citing the relevant IRS tax code. Thank you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBest regards,<br />\r\nLogan', '2013-04-29 22:49:01', '84#1027015.pdf,', 0, NULL, '0'),

Program data compiled by PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE including, but not limited to, numbers and calculations regarding Actions and associated Commissions (“Program Data”), will be calculated by PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE through the use of industry standard tracking technology and shall be final and binding on You. Any questions regarding the Program Data must be submitted in writing within fourteen (14) days of initial appearance in the tracking system; otherwise the Program Data will be deemed to be accurate and accepted by You.

Terms of the Agreement are subject to PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE hardware, software, and bandwidth traffic limitations. PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE”s failure to deliver because of technical difficulties does not represent a failure to meet the obligations of the Agreement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n    b. Tracking Commissions. PEPPERJAM shall recognize actual Commissionsthat should be credited to Publisher’s Account. PEPPERJAM may, at times, apply an estimated amount of Commissions, if there is a verified error in Merchant’s tracking code.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n    c. Access to Tracking and Reporting Tools. PEPPERJAM shall provide Publisher with access to tracking and reporting tools, and to other various support services that will be updated from time to time on the<br />\r\n    network website.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n    d.

On or around the 1st and 15th day of each calendar month, PEPPERJAM will issue to Publisher any positive balance in Publisher’s Account for Transactions reported for the previous relevant period. PEPPERJAM shall have no obligation to make payment of any Commissions for which PEPPERJAM has not received payment from the relevant Merchant of all monies due to PEPPERJAM (including for all Commissions owed by such Merchant to all of such Merchant’s Publishers) until such payment has been received. Instead, Publisher shall have the right to pursue any and all legal remedies directly against any Merchant that has not made funds available to pay sums due and owing to Publisher for Commissions earned in connection with a particular program. All Publisher accounts will be paid in US Dollars ($US). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Commissions will be issued for any amounts otherwise due Publisher that total less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) (“Payment Threshold”). Upon termination of the Agreement, all legitimate moneys due to Publisher that actually collected from the applicable Merchant, even amounts below the Payment Threshold, will be paid during the next billing cycle. Every Publisher must have a unique, valid taxpayer identification number (TIN), valid Social Security Number, or other applicable unique government identification. All payments due hereunder shall be in U.S. dollars and are exclusive of any applicable taxes. Publisher shall be responsible for all applicable taxes. A Merchant may request that PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE, or PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE may on its own initiative, debit from the Commissions otherwise due and owing Publisher an amount equal to a Commission previously credited to Publisher”s account where: (a) a return or cancellation has been made with respect to the applicable product and/or service; (b) there is an instance of a duplicate, fraudulent or incomplete entry or other similar error with respect to a customer order; (c) there are Actions that do not comply fully with the terms of the Agreement, including where the applicable non-complying Action is not the result of Publisher’s action, omission and/or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement; (d) there is non-receipt of payment from, or refund of payment to, the customer that entered into the subject Action; or (e) there is any failure on the part of the Publisher to comply with the Agreement and or applicable Program Terms (collectively referred to as a “Reversal”). Reversals requested by a Merchant in accordance with this Section may be applied up to sixty (60) days after the end of the month in which the applicable Commission was earned (“Reversal Period”). Merchant may request that the payment of a Commission be postponed for one (1) payment cycle where: (i) Merchant is verifying a lead (for Programs in which lead generation is a component of the Action); (ii) Advertiser has a product return policy that allows the underlying purchaser to return the product during the Reversal Period; or (iii) the applicable Program Terms provide for such a postponement. The number or amount of Actions, credits for payments and debits for Reversals, as calculated by PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE, shall be final and binding on Publisher.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n    f. Fraud. PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE actively monitors traffic, Actions, Commissions and other Program-related activities for potential fraud. If PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE suspects that Your account has been used in a fraudulent manner, Your account will be deactivated effective immediately and with no notice to You pending further investigation. If You add Actions, or inflate Actions, through the use of fraudulent means of traffic generation, as determined solely by PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE, You will forfeit all of the Commissions related to that Program, and Your Publisher account will be terminated effective immediately. PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE reserves sole judgment in determining fraud and You agree to be bound by any and all such determinations. It is the OBLIGATION of Publisher to prove to PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE that it has NOT engaged in fraud. PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE will hold Your Commission-related payments in ‘Pending or Delayed Status’ until You have satisfactorily provided evidence that demonstrates to PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE that You have not engaged in fraud. If you are unable to provide PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE with satisfactory evidence that You have not engaged in fraud within seven (7) days of Your Commissions being placed in “Pending or Delayed Status,” then PEPPERJAM EXCHANGE reserves the right to terminate Your Publisher account and cancel payment on the applicable Commissions, at its sole discretion and without any further obligations to You.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Proprietary Rights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n    a. Linking to Merchants. For each Merchant’s Program that Publisher has applied to and been accepted to, the Merchant is granting to Publisher the right to Link to the Merchant’s Web site or Web Offers in accordance with the Merchant’s Program terms and the terms of this Pepperjam Network Agreement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n    b.

Body Building refused to issue any commission for many transactions ( we discovered they have been removing tracked transactions prior to reach us out. Their affiliate manager claimed that all clicks are originated from Google and not from our website. Panda CashBack can\'t track any transaction not reported by Body Building affiliate program ( as the tracking code reside on their website and not ours). Therefore we can\'t verify any transaction that they claim it doesn\'t happen through our website. The issue was escalated even to the network. I tried to reach both affiliate managers of Body Building, their live support, and every possible contact person in this company but we were ignored.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince we are a middle party between you and these advertisers, if the company refused to cooperate with us when there is a problem, we ask our users to reach to the company directly to understand why are they denying the commission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe provided our users the affiliate manager contact information (please let me know if you need both affiliate manager in body building to get in touch with them).

There is an EN button in the upper corners of both <a href=\"http://www.moneta.ru\">www.moneta.ru</a> and <a href=\"http://www.payanyway.ru\">www.payanyway.ru</a> – it should work. However, both websites are going through major update right now, so if something is still wrong with translation, don’t be surprised. Moneta is our own e-wallet and PayAnyWay is our merchant portal.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithdrawals:<br />\r\n•    Bank cards issued by Russian banks - 1%  ($1 min), CIS banks – 2% ($4 min)<br />\r\n•    Yandex e-wallet – 1%<br />\r\n•    QIWI e-wallets - 1.2% <br />\r\n•    Moneta e-wallet - 0%<br />\r\n•    Money transfers CONTACT – 2% <br />\r\n•    Russian and CIS mobile operators - 1%<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo other fees. Your settlement transfer to your account in our system and its maintenance is free. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuick points:<br />\r\n•  All methods besides CONTACT Money transfers are instant. <br />\r\n•  Interaction through API, customer always stays in your interface during withdrawal. <br />\r\n•  Settlement to us in any currency (e.g. USD, Euro, Pounds) but customers receive payouts in rubles (we handle FX). The only exception – Moneta e-wallet – where customers can choose to receive money in foreign currency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, it’s a brief intro on fees and how it works. The main idea of the service is to let Russian customers receive money to the e-wallets that they traditionally use in Russia or directly to cards without having to set up an account with another payment service like PayPal. Besides that, money received to traditional Russian e-wallets are more immediately available compared to PayPal. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI will be looking forward to hearing from you.

Orbitz, both we and BookingBuddy are affiliate of the company, if you use BookingBuddy , who have their affiliate program they would share part of the commission with us ( which we giving it back to you. If you go through Panda CashBack to Orbitz, you are sharing the commission that Orbitz give us directly which tend to be higher. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n2 - BookingBuddy doesn\'t share the commission % with us, all we know is that they will be giving us 27% of the commission, how much that commission can\'t be exact % because they are aggregating multiple travel sites each one with different commission structure. All I can say 27% of the commission would be definitely lower than the rebate we give u directly, because we give you 50% - 100% of the commission, sometimes even higher. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n3- Please, check the BookingBuddy page, we write any restriction about a store in that section which highlight what they offering is a percentage of a commission and not of the total purchase unlike majority of travel sites. For example if we giving back 3% on Orbitz that mean of your total payment. Also, if you go directly through BookingBuddy, they wouldn\'t give you any cashback ( they are a comparison site for travel sites ). <br />\r\n<br />\r\n4- You mentioned that the purchases were for airfares, Airline tickets rebate is one of the lowers ( hotel, cars, and packages tend to be higher ). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am not aware of what purchase you made at bookingbuddy because they don\'t share that with us, but if you willing to share more detail like how much you spent, at what site, and they type of purchase, i can tell you what to expect if you shopping using Panda CashBack at Expedia, Orbitz, or any other travel website ( and show you how significantly higher the cashback would be ). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease, let me know if there is anything I can assist you with. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI will contact BookingBuddy affiliate manager and ask them for a better structure as I can see even with us trying to do our best explaining it, it still confusing compare to any other travel site we partnered with so far.<br />\n<br />\nSincerely,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPanda CashBack Support<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pandacashback.com\">www.pandacashback.com</a><br />\n', '2016-02-16 17:57:35', '', 1, NULL, '1'),

I purchased $76.50 on <a href=\"http://dermstore.com\">dermstore.com</a> through clicking through on Panda, but I don\'t think I\'m getting the cashback for it because I\'m pretty sure the $9.95 is the signup bonus.
